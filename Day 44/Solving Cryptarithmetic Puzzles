Solving Cryptarithmetic Puzzles

Newspapers and magazines often have crypt-arithmetic puzzles of the form:

  SEND
+ MORE
--------
 MONEY
-------- 
 The goal here is to assign each letter a digit from 0 to 9 so that the arithmetic works out correctly. The rules are that all occurrences of a letter must be assigned the same digit, and no digit can be assigned to more than one letter.

First, create a list of all the characters that need assigning to pass to Solve
If all characters are assigned, return true if puzzle is solved, false otherwise
Otherwise, consider the first unassigned character
for (every possible choice among the digits not in use)
If all digits have been tried and nothing worked, return false to trigger backtracking



static boolean exhaustiveSolve(Puzzle puzzle, String lettersToAssign) {
    if (lettersToAssign.isEmpty()) // no more choices to make
        return puzzleSolved(puzzle); // checks arithmetic to see if works
    for (int digit = 0; digit <= 9; digit++) // try all digits
    {
        if (assignLetterToDigit(lettersToAssign.charAt(0), digit)) {
            if (exhaustiveSolve(puzzle, lettersToAssign.substring(1)))
                return true;
            unassignLetterFromDigit(lettersToAssign.charAt(0), digit);
        }
}
    return false; // nothing worked, need to backtrack
}
